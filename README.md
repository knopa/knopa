## üëå **Recommendations**

<aside>
üí° Sergey worked with my company as a senior developer on the implementation of a custom built e-commerce platform. Sergey brought excellent knowledge and experience to the team, both from a technical and domain side. He helped architect the system, recommended best of breed solutions, implement accordingly and liaise with our product owners and UX team. I would highly recommend Sergey to any future employers.

<aside>
üí° Sergey was instrumental in developing our applications at Livelii. He consistently demonstrated leadership, innovation, and the ability to think critically about our business and apply this to our technology. He would be an asset to any technical team looking for high caliber, team player who learns and adapts quickly.

‚Äî **Anya Switzer, Co-Founder at Livelii**

<aside>
üí° The word troubleshooter means Sergey Slepokurov. He was one of the contributors to the first version of the YayPay application. Sergey was also consulting us on technology preference, architecture, and ERP integrations for a long time. Awesome technical skills are not the only power of him. Sergey shows an extraordinary proactive level not only handling backlog but also predicting possible issues. Being both a great engineer and a smart manager I bet Sergey is the best option for any product.
I worked with Sergey even before YayPay for many years, and he's definitely my go-to choice when it comes to making the right technology decision that will server you short and long term. You know that the best engineers are 10x better than the average ones, and he's definitely top 1% of those. If you have a chance to work with him - you can consider yourself very lucky.
